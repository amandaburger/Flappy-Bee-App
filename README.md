# Flappy-Bee-App
A mock flappy bird app.  The user, a bee travels through the obstacles, that are flowers.  To make the app I used a game view controller and created my own sprites. Using photoshop I created both the flower and bee images.  I also used spritekit and collision detection along with real physics for the game scene.
